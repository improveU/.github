> 🏋Improve yourself with Im.ProveYou - Courses for better health. 🏋️‍♀️

## Introduction

We are a group of five people:

- 📢 [Tim Bernhard](https://github.com/th3gumm3l) | Project Manager & Allrounder
- 📚 [Demian Flury](https://github.com/DemianFlury) | Backend Developer and overall badass
- 📚 [Xavier Scherer](https://github.com/Tschawi) | Head of Finance
- 💻 [Yannic Studer](https://github.com/FireNick44) | Frontend Developer
- 💻 [Elija Zürcher](https://github.com/ElijaZuercher) | Frontend Developer

Our goal is to provide an interface for the creators and the users. This interface enables the creators to offer courses for their own health and self-realisation. Users can then access those courses and, for example, improve their health through better nutrition and try out different workouts. The workouts cover many categories such as calisthenics, bodyweight or gym only.

At Im.ProveYou, we are motivated to provide you with the best interface to guide you on your path to success.
